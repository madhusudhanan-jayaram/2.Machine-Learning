# Machine Learning Assignment

## Project: Attrition Prediction

### Objective
Predict which employees are likely to resign in the future using supervised machine learning techniques.

### Problem Statement
Employee resignations cause delays in project delivery. This project aims to build a model that predicts employee attrition so the company can take preventive actions.

### Domain
Machine Learning

### Learning Model
Supervised Learning - Binary Classification (Resigned: Yes/No)

### Dataset
A dummy dataset containing employee details and their resignation status.

### Features Include
- Employee Number
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Role
- Total Experience
- Job Satisfaction (1 to 5)
- Work Life Balance (1 to 5)
- Last Rating (1 to 5)
- Last Promotion Year
- Monthly Income
- Years at Company
- Resigned (Target variable)

### How It Works
The model learns from past employee data where resignation status is known and predicts which current employees may resign. This helps management plan resources and avoid project delays.
